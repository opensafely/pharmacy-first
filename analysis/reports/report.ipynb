    "This study used data from OpenSAFELY-TPP, which covers 40% of the population of England. For a description of the representativeness of this sample, please see our manuscript [here](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.18010.1). Individuals were included if they were alive and registered at a TPP practice each month, across the study period. Patients were excluded if their listed age was not between 0 and 120 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts represent patients with at least one clinical code of relevence in that month. Patients with more than one of the same clinical code in a month were only counted once. Rates divide the count by the included study population and multiply by 1,000 to achieve a rate per 1,000 registered patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts <=7 have been redacted and all numbers rounded to the nearest 5 to avoid potential re-identification of individuals. The rates displayed were computed with these rounded counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data relies on a relevent Pharmacy First code being added to a patient's GP record. The Pharmacy First service relies on [GP Connect: Update Record](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp-connect/gp-connect-in-your-organisation/gp-connect-update-record) to update a patient's GP record with consultation information from the community pharmacy. Following the launch of the Pharmacy First service, there has been a [gradual roll-out of GP Connect: Update Record](https://cpe.org.uk/our-news/gp-connect-update-record-rollout-and-flow-of-information/) across the approved community pharmacy IT system suppliers.\n",
